This extension provides various helper commands.

## Provided Features

-   **Hediet Power Tools: Apply Rename** (bound to F2). Renames identifiers after you already changed them.

    This is incredible useful if combined with other multi cursor features.

    ![](./docs/demo-apply-rename.gif)

    This feature is currently limited to renaming at most 2 identifiers at once.
    Help me developing this extension by sponsoring me on github!
    Once I reach 10 sponsors I will remove this restriction.

## Planned Commands (Not Implemented Yet)

-   Extend all selections until a selected character is found (inspired by `yo1dog.multi-cursor-search`).
-   Replace all selections with the result of a javascript function (inspired by `map-replace.js`).
